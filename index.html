                        <li>He renounced his German citizenship when he was 16. From an early age, Albert Einstein loathed nationalism of any kind and considered it preferable to be a “citizen of the world.” When he was 16, he renounced his German citizenship and was officially state-less until he became a Swiss citizen in 1901.</li>
                        <li>In 1933, the FBI began keeping a dossier on Albert Einstein, shortly before his third trip to the U.S. This file would grow into 1,427 pages of documents focused on Einstein’s lifelong association with pacifist and socialist organizations.</li>
                        <li> Anticipating winning a Nobel Prize, Einstein offered all his expected prize money to his first wife, Mileva Marić, so she would agree to grant him a divorce. The award added up to $32,250, which was more than ten times the annual salary of the average professor at the time./li>
                        <li>Elsa, the second Mrs. Einstein, was the daughter of Albert’s mother’s sister, making them first cousins. They were also second cousins, as Elsa’s father and Albert’s father were cousins. Her maiden name was Einstein.</li>
                        <li>Einstein married his cousin, his second wife Elsa was actually his first cousin and her middle name was even Einstein.</li>
                        <li>Einstein was a strong supporter of civil rights and free speech. When W.E.B. Du Bois was indicted in 1951 as an unregistered agent for a foreign power, Einstein volunteered to testify as a character witness on his behalf. After Du Bois’s lawyer informed the court that Einstein would appear, the judge decided to dismiss the case.</li>
                        <li>Einstein’s first marriage to the mother of his child, Mileva Maric, lasted 16 years and had a contract outlining terms and conditions including the receipt of ‘3 meals a day to his room’.</li>
                        <li>A depressed parrot was the focus of Einstein’s interest during the scientists 70’s. He told it jokes to try and make it less depressed.</li>
                        <li>Edgar Hoover tried to keep Einstein out of the country only to be overruled by the U.S. State Department.</li>
                        <li>Even though he will be remembered for his work with relativity, Einstein received his Nobel for his work with the Photoelectric effect.</li>
